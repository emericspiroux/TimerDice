## TIMER DICE

Timerdice is a timetracker dice like [Timeular](https://timeular.com/) do, but in open source !


### Supported platforms

### Print your Dice and connect wire

`STL files` will come sooner as possible (Not really finished yet ðŸ˜…), contact me if you want Fusion360 files or current STL files.

When your dice is printed you will need :

- 1x ESP32 WEMOS Mini D1
- 1x Batterie shield
- 1x Batterie 720mAh (Normally for drone)
- 1x MPU6050
- Wires !

Connection Schema available soon as possible but meanwhile :

- MPU6050 -> ESP32
  - INT -> IO4
  - SCL -> IO22
  - SDA -> IO21


### Create your own TimerDice distribution

You need to have Xcode >= 12.2 installed for [@abandonware/noble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abandonware/noble) module. (Thanks to the team for this awesome work)

Now you just need to launch `npm run build` on root folder.

Distribution will be available into `back/out`
